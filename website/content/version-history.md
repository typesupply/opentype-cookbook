Initial version.

### Future Versions

#### Near Future

- Update the fonts used for all text to include kerning. (I'm working on it!)
- Illustrations for each feature in Common Techniques.
- Animated step through of the processing sequence in Foundation Concepts.
- Add something about the methodology for developing complex features: don't dive into code. Rather make some examples of what you want the final result to look like, find the visual patterns within that and build the code from there.

#### Distant Future

- Include information and examples for the additional positioning rule types.
- Add a troubleshooting section. ([See this commit for a list.](https://github.com/typesupply/opentype-feature-intro/commit/00ae80400faf8f645cfab58b1b1b1a6c2e4dfd7f))
- Add a section detailing what isn't covered by this cookbook. ([See this commit for a list.](https://github.com/typesupply/opentype-feature-intro/commit/00ae80400faf8f645cfab58b1b1b1a6c2e4dfd7f))
