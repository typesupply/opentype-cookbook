OpenType features allow fonts to behave smartly. This behavior can do simple things (e.g. change letters to small caps) or they can do complex things (e.g. insert swashes, alternates, and ligatures to make text set in a script font feel handmade). This cookbook aims to be a designer friendly introduction to understanding and developing these features. The goal is not to teach you how to write a small caps feature or a complex script feature. Rather, the goal is to teach you the logic and techniques for developing features. Once you understand those, you’ll be able to create OpenType features that fit your design as perfectly as possible.

This cookbook is written with the assumption that you have a basic working knowledge of the structure of a font. You need to know the differences between characters and glyphs, understand the coordinate system in glyphs and so on. If you aren’t familiar with that, go study the basics and then come back. This will all make a lot more sense that way.

## Your Author

I’m [Tal Leming](http://typesupply.com) and I started developing OpenType features around 2002 or 2003. Since then I have developed the OpenType features for a number of [fonts](http://www.houseind.com/fonts/edbenguiatfonts) [that](http://www.houseind.com/fonts/studiolettering) [do](http://christianschwartz.com/local.shtml) [weird](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/julien/about) [things](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/irma). I only write OpenType features for my own fonts now, so I am semi-retired from day-to-day OpenType feature programming. However I teach type design at [MICA](http://mica.edu) and a number of my students have expressed interest in developing their own OpenType features and there wasn’t a good from the ground up introduction to this and...here we are. (Hi to my students!)

I mean, if you really, really, really want to donate, you can if you insist. But, keep your budget in mind, please.
