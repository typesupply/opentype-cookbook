Thanks to the Adobe Type Department for developing the .fea syntax. It gets criticized from time to time, but it is actually a great abstraction of the GSUB, GPOS and GDEF binary data structures. I’ve tried, and failed, to invent a better syntax several times. .fea is hard to beat. Thanks Adobe!

Thanks to [Ben Kiel](http://benkiel.com), [Frank Grießhammer](http://frgr.de), [Miguel Sousa](http://adobe.com/type) and [Erik van Blokland](http://letterror.com) for graciously reading, editing and making suggestions about early drafts of this cookbook.

[Brook Elgie](http://brookelgie.com) built the infrastructure for the site and did most of the styling work. I am hugely thankful for his efforts because CSS and me are not friends.

Thanks to [Frederik Berlean](http://typemytype.com) for many things, especially his [Pygments lexer for the .fea syntax](https://github.com/typemytype/OpenTypeFeatureLexer).

Thanks to [Mr. Ken Barber](http://typeandlettering.com) for designing typefaces that needed bizarre feature behavior that had never existed before.

Finally, thanks to my students for being so curious that it made me finally get around to writing this cookbook.
