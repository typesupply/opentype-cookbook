# Read Me First

**This is an in-progress rough draft. Your feedback is welcome!**

This is currently a single Markdown formatted file. Once the first draft has been reviewed by a few peers I will convert this to Sphinx format. It will most likely end up as a small static website that I host. I considered using the great Read The Docs for this, but the .fea code will require a custom syntax highlighter and RTD doesn't seem to support that.

This needs a nice title. OpenType Features Intro is only a placeholder. Your suggestions are more than welcome! A current list of potential titles:

# Introduction

OpenType features allow fonts to behave smartly. This behavior can do simple things (e.g. change letters to small caps) or they can do complex things (insert swashes, alternates, and ligatures to make text set in a script font feel handmade). This document aims to be a designer friendly introduction to understanding and developing these features. The goal is not to teach you how to write a small caps feature or a complex script feature. Rather, the goal is to teach you the logic and techniques for developing features. Once you understand those, you'll be able to create OpenType features to take your own design one step further.

This document is written with the assumption that you have a basic working knowledge of the structure of a font. You need to know the differences between characters and glyphs, understand the coordinate system in glyphs and so on.

OpenType is writing direction agnostic, but the examples in this document are for left to right writing systems. Refer to the official OpenType specifications for further information on this matter.


# Foundation Concepts

Before we get into writing any code, let's first establish what we are actually building and how it works. This is probably the toughest thing to understand about OpenType features, but understanding the underlying mechanics will free you to build new and innovative features of your own.

## Structures

In OpenType we can define behaviors that we want to happen upon request from users. For example, the user may decide that text should be displayed with small caps. You, the type designer, can define which glyphs should be changed when this request is made by the user. These behaviors are defined in features. Features can do two things: they can substitute glyphs and they can adjust the positions of glyphs.

The actual behavior within the features are defined with rules. Following the small caps example above, you can define a rule that states that the `a` glyph should be replaced with `A.sc`.

Within a feature, it is often necessary to group a set of rules together. This group of rules is called a lookup.  
_I think you might be jumping into lookups (an advanced concept) too early. While it is clear to us that every feature block basically is a lookup, I think it would be easier to first state really simple substitutions; e.g. ligatures._

Visually, you can think of features, lookups and rules like this:

    feature
      lookup
        rule
        rule
        ...
      lookup
      ...
    feature
    ...

## Processing

When text is processed, the features that the user wants applied are gathered into two groups: substitution features and positioning features. The substitution features are processed first and then the positioning features are processed. The order in which you have defined the features, lookups and rules is the order in which they will be applied to the text. This order is very important.

Features process sequences of glyphs. These glyph runs may represent a complete line of text or a sub-section of a line of text.

For example, let's assume that you have the following features, lookups and rules:

    feature: small caps
        lookup: letters
            replace a with A.sc
            replace b with B.sc
            ...
            replace z with Z.sc
        lookup: numbers
            replace zero with zero.sc
            ...
            replace nine with nine.sc
    feature: ligatures
        lookup: basic
            replace f f i with f_f_i
            replace f f l with f_f_l
            replace f f with f_f
            replace f i with f_i
            replace f l with f_l

_Code shown in a code format – without actually being real code – might be problematic._  
(Note: this is an odd example. there is no reason for the lookups, but I can't think of a way to show lookups at this point that doesn't make things overly complex.)

Let's also assume that the user wants to apply small caps and ligatures to a glyph run that displays "Hello".

A glyph run is processed one feature at a time. So, here is what "Hello" will look like as it enters and exists each feature:

    (this will be an illustration)
    Hello > [feature: small caps] > Hello (with ello in .sc)
    Hello (with ello in .sc) > [feature: ligatures] > Hello (with ello in .sc)

Within each feature, the glyph run is processed one lookup at a time. Here is what our example looks like as it moves through the small caps feature:

    (this will be an illustration)
    Hello > [lookup: letters] > Hello (with ello in .sc)
    Hello (with ello in .sc) > [lookup: numbers] > Hello (with ello in .sc)

Within each lookup, things are a little different. The glyph run is passed one glyph at a time from beginning to end over each rule within the lookup. If a rule transforms the current glyph, the following rules are skipped for the current glyph. The next glyph is then current through the lookup. That's complex, so let's look at it with our example:

    (this will be an illustration)
    H ello > [replace a with A.sc] > H ello
    H ello > [replace b with B.sc] > H ello
    ...
    H ello > [replace z with Z.sc] > H ello

    e llo > [replace a with A.sc] > H e llo
    e llo > [replace b with B.sc] > H e llo
    ...
    e llo > [replace e with E.sc] > H (E.sc) llo
    (the rest are skipped)

    l lo > [replace a with A.sc] > H(E.sc) l lo
    l lo > [replace b with B.sc] > H(E.sc) l lo
    ...
    l lo > [replace l with L.sc] > H(E.sc) (L.sc) lo
    (the rest are skipped)

    l o > [replace a with A.sc] > H(E.sc)(L.sc) l o
    l o > [replace b with B.sc] > H(E.sc)(L.sc) l o
    ...
    l o > [replace l with L.sc] > H(E.sc)(L.sc) (L.sc) o
    (the rest are skipped)

    o > [replace a with A.sc] > H(E.sc)(L.sc)(L.sc) o
    o > [replace b with B.sc] > H(E.sc)(L.sc)(L.sc) o
    ...
    o > [replace o with O.sc] > H(E.sc)(L.sc)(L.sc) (O.sc)
    (the rest are skipped)

Here is our example, animated:

    (ideally I will be able to include an animation of a complete processing run)

The process is the same for positioning features, except that instead of rule evaluation stopping when a glyph is transformed, the evaluation is stopped when a glyph's position is changed.

That's how processing works and it is the most complex part of OpenType features that you will need to understand. Got it? Great!

(For you experts reading this: Yeah, I know this isn't technically 100% accurate. But, I don't really want to confuse everyone by going through the processing model with the GSUB and GPOS data structures. Those are different from the .fea syntax just enough to make things **very confusing** unless you know both sides of the process very well. So, I'm going to explain the processing model following the .fea structures.)

_This whole Processing section made things feel very complex very fast. Can it be removed, moved to an Advanced Knowledge section, or moved to later in the document?_

# Syntax Intro

We will be writing our features in the [Adobe OpenType Feature File Syntax](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html) (commonly referred to as ".fea"). .fea is a simple, text format that is easily editable in text and font editors. There are other syntaxes and tools for developing features, but .fea is the most widely supported and the most easily accessible. We'll be going through the important parts of .fea in detail, but for now we need to establish some basics.

## Comments

It's useful to be able to write comments about your code. To do this, add a # and everything from the # to the end of the line of text will be marked as a comment.

    # This is a comment.

Comments are ignored when your font is compiled, so you can write anything you want in your comments.

## White Space

In some syntaxes the amount of white space is important. This is not the case in .fea. You can use spaces, tabs and line breaks as much and in any combination as you like.

## Special Characters

Some characters have special meanings in .fea.

### ;

A semicolon indicates the closing of something--a feature, lookup, rule, etc. These are important.

### {}

Braces enclose the contents of a feature or lookup.

### []

Brackets enclose the contents of a class.

## Features

Features are identified with a four character tag. These are either [registered tags](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featurelist.htm) or private tags. Unless you have a very good reason to create a private tag, you should always use the registered tags. Applications that support OpenType features use these tags to identify which features are supported in your font. For example, if you have a feature with the smcp tag, applications will know that your font supports small caps.

Features are defined with the feature keyword, the appropriate tag, a pair of braces, the tag again, and a semicolon.

    feature smcp {
        # lookups and rules go here
    } smcp;

## Lookups

Lookups are defined in a similar way to features. They have a name, but the name is not restricted to four characters or to a tag database. You can make up your own name, as long as it follows the general naming rules.

    lookup Letters {
        # rules go here
    } Letters;

## Classes

You'll often run into situations where you want use a group of glyphs in a rule. These groups are called classes and they are defined with a list of glyph names or class names inside of brackets.

    [A E I O U Y]

Classes can have a name assigned to them so that they can be used more than once. Class names follow the general naming rules and they are always preceded with an @. To create a named class you set the name, then an =, then the class definition and end it with a semicolon.

    @vowels = [A E I O U Y];

After a class has been defined, it can be referenced by name.

    @vowels

## General Naming Rules

A name for a glyph, class or lookup must adhere to the following constraints:

- No more than 31 characters in length.
- Only use characters in A-Z a-z 0-9 . _
- Must not start with a number or a period.

You should avoid naming anything (including glyphs) with the same name as a [reserved keyword](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#2.c). If you do need to name a glyph with one of these names, precede an reference to the glyph with a `.` But, really, try to avoid needing to do this.

# Rules

Now that we have introduced some terminology, covered the way text is processed and established the general syntax rules, we can get into the fun part: actually doing stuff.

## Substitutions

Substitutions are the most visually transformative thing that features can do to text. And, they are easy to understand. There are two main parts to a substitution:

1. Target -- This is what will be replaced.
2. Replacement -- This is what will be inserted in place of the target.

The syntax for a substitution is:

    substitute target by replacement;

We can abbreviate substitute with sub to cut down on how much stuff we have to type, so let's do that:

    sub target by replacement;

Targets and replacements can often be classes. These classes can be referenced by name or they can be defined as an unnamed class inside of a rule.

### Replace One With One

To replace one thing with another, you do this:

    sub target by replacement;

(In the .fea documentation, this is known as GSUB Lookup Type 1: Single Substitution.)

For example, to transform a to A.sc, you would do this:

    sub a by A.sc;

If you want to replace several things with corresponding things, you can use classes as both the target and the replacement. However, in this case the number of things in the two classes needs to be the same, unlike above.

    sub [a b c] by [A.sc B.sc C.sc];

It's usually more readable to define the classes earlier in your code and then reference them by name.

    sub @lowercase by @smallcaps;

The order of the glyphs in your classes in this situation is critical. In the example above, the classes will correspond with each other like this:

    a -> A.sc
    b -> B.sc
    c -> C.sc

If you order the target and replacement classes incorrectly, things will go wrong. For example, if you have this as your rule:

    sub [a b c] by [B.sc C.sc A.sc];

The classes will correspond like this:

    a -> B.sc
    b -> C.sc
    c -> A.sc

This is obviously undesired behavior, so keep your classes ordered properly.

### Replace Many With One

To replace a sequence of things with one thing, you do this:

    sub target sequence with replacement;

(In the .fea documentation, this is known as GSUB Lookup Type 4: Ligature Substitution.)

For example, for a fi ligature, you would do this:

    sub f i by f_i;

You can also use classes as part of the target sequence:

    sub @f @i by f_i;

Or:

    sub @f i by f_i;

Or:

    sub f @i by f_i;

### Replace One With Many

To replace a sequence of things with a single thing, you do this:

    sub target by replacement sequence;

(In the .fea documentation, this is known as GSUB Lookup Type 2: Multiple Substitution.)

For example, to convert an fi ligature back into f and i, you would do this:

    sub f_i by f i;

Classes can't be used as the target or the replacement in this rule type.

### Replace One From Many

To give the user a choice of alternates, you do this:

    sub target from replacement;

(In the .fea documentation, this is known as GSUB Lookup Type 3: Alternate Substitution.)

The replacement must be a glyph class, and (unlike above) does not happen automatically, but usually requires active user interaction (e.g. picking glyphs from a selection of alternates).

For example, to give the user several options to replace a with, you would do this:

    sub a from [a.alt1 a.alt2 a.alt3];

Note that the keyword in the middle of the rule is *from* instead of *by*.

## Positioning

Positioning glyphs may not be as visually interesting as what can be achieved with substitution, but the positioning support in OpenType is incredibly powerful and important. The positioning rules can be broken into two separate categories:

1. Simple Rules -- These adjust either the space around one glyph or the space between two glyphs.
2. Mind-Blowingly Complex and Astonishingly Powerful Rules -- These do things like properly shift combining marks to align precisely with the base forms in Arabic and Devanagari so that things look incredibly spontaneous and beautiful.

We're going to cover the simple rules in this document. The complex rules are amazing, but too advanced for now.

### Position and Advance

Before we go much further we need to talk about coordinate systems and value records. As you know, the coordinate system in fonts is based on X and Y axes. The X axis moves from left to right with numbers increasing as you move to the right. The Y axis moves from bottom to top with numbers increasing as you move up. The origin for these axis is the intersection of the 0 X coordinate, otherwise known as the baseline, and the 0 Y coordinate.

    (illustration showing a g with the origin and axes highlighted)

In the positioning rules, we can adjust the placement and advance of glyphs. The placement is the spot at which the origin of the glyph will be aligned. The advance is the width and the height of the glyph from the origin. In horizontal typesetting, the height will be zero and the width will be the width of the glyph. The placement and advance can each be broken down into X and Y values. Thus, there is an x placement, a y placement, an x advance and a y advance.

    (illustration showing a g with the placements and advance highlighted. be sure to clearly show the advance width of the glyph.)

The units that these values represent are the same units in which you have drawn your glyph. Together, these four values form a value record. In the .fea syntax, we express these value records like this:

    <xPlacement yPlacement xAdvance yAdvance>

For example:

    <1 2 3 4>

In this case, the value record is adjusting the x placement to the right by one unit, the y placement up by two units, the x advance by 3 units and the y advance by four units.

When the positioning features are started, each glyph in the glyph run has a value record of `<0 0 0 0>`. As the processing happens and rules are matched, these value records are modified cumulative. So, if one feature adjust a glyph's x placement by 10 units and then another feature adjust the glyph's x placement by 30 units, the glyph's x placement would be 40 units.

_I think this paragraph has too much detail, and may be better placed later in the doc._

The syntax for a positioning rule is:

    position target valueRecord;

We can abbreviate position with pos to cut down on how much stuff we have to type, so let's do that:

    pos target valueRecord;

Targets can be classes. These classes can be referenced by name or they can be defined as an unnamed class inside of a rule.

### Adjust the Position of One Glyph

To adjust the space around a single target, you do this:

    pos target valueRecord;

(In the .fea documentation, this is known as GPOS Lookup Type 1: Single Adjustment Positioning.)

For example, to put some space to the left and right of the A, you would do this:

    pos A <10 0 20 0>;

		(illustration showing before and after)

### Adjust the Space Between Two Glyphs

To adjust the space between two targets, you do this:

    pos target1 target2 valueRecord;

(In the .fea documentation, this is known as GPOS Lookup Type 2: Pair Adjustment Positioning.)

In this case, you can shorten the value record to be only the x advance adjustment. Or, you can use the full value record if you prefer that.

This rule is used almost exclusively for kerning. In fact, this is so common that you shouldn't have to write any of these rules yourself. Your font and/or kerning editor should do this for you.

You can use a class as target1, target2 or both:

    pos @A T -50;

Or:

    pos A @T -50;

Or:

    pos @A @T -50;

But, seriously, let your editor write these rules for you.


## Substitutions and Positioning Based on Context

The substitution and positioning rules that we have discussed so far are quite useful, but the real power is in triggering these rules only when certain conditions are met. These are known as contextual rules.

Contextual rules allow us to specify a sequence before the target, a sequence after the target or both in a substitution or positioning rule. For example: replace `r` with `r.alt` if the `r` is preceded by `wo` and followed by `ds`. There are two new parts of this rule type in addition to the parts we defined in the substitution and positioning sections.

1. Backtrack -- This is the sequence of things that occur before the target in the rule. This sequence can be composed of glyphs, classes or a mix of both.
2. Lookahead -- This is the sequence of glyphs that occur after the target in the rule. Like the backtrack, this sequence can be composed of glyphs, classes or a mix of both.

The backtrack and lookahead are both optional. Either, or neither, can appear. If a sequence is present, it can contain one or more things.

In addition to the backtrack and lookahead, a new character is needed in these rules: '. This character is used to mark the target of the rule.

Here is the words example from above in the correct syntax:

    sub w o r' d s by r.alt;

All of the substitution and positioning rule types can be defined with a context.

- replace one with one: `sub a b' c by b.alt;`
- replace many with one: `sub a b' c' d by b_c;`
- replace one with many: `sub a b_c' d by b c;` _I don't think this syntax is allowed. To do this you need to do `b_c -> b c` in a standalone lookup, and then refer to that lookup in the context._
- replace one from many: `sub a b' c from [b.alt1 b.alt2];` _I don't think this is supported either_
- adjust position of one glyph: `pos A B' C <10 0 20 0>;`
- adjust positioning of the space between two glyphs: `pos A B' C' D -50;` _The value record needs to be used after the context, not at the very end. This `pos A B' C' -50 D;` will compile, but I don't know if it will produce the desired results._

Please note that just because you can apply this to all rule types doesn't mean that it always makes sense; or that you should.

### Exceptions

What if we have a short context that you want to match, but a longer context that contains the short context? For example, say we want to change the r in words but not in words!. To do that we can specify an exception to the contextual rule. For example:

    ignore sub w o r' d s exclam;
    sub w o r' d s by r.alt;

The ignore keyword followed by a backtrack (optional), target and lookahead (optional) creates the exception. _It's very important to note that once you use a ' in the ignore, the following subsistution also needs to use a ', even if it is a simple case of sub group by group with no other contextual lookahead or backtrack._


## Advanced Techniques

By now we have established the rules needed to make most features that you'll want to add to your fonts--small caps, ligatures, tabular figures, etc. But, when you want to do some more complex things, you'll need a few more things.

### Language Systems

One of OpenType's best attributes is the way that it handles languages and scripts. We can define rules that only apply when the user has indicated that they are writing a particular language or using a particular script. To do this, we state the script and the language that the rules apply to. After these have been made, all subsequent rules in the feature belong to this language and script unless you declare another language and script.

Let's look at an example. Let's say that we have a special IJ that should only be used when Dutch is the declared language. We need to say: when the script is latin and the language is Dutch, replace IJ with IJ.alt. Here is how we do that:

    script latn;
    language NLD;
    sub IJ by IJ.dutch;

The script tags are defined [here](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/scripttags.htm) and language tags are defined [here](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/opentype/languagetags.aspx).

If you add language or script specific rules you also need to register that the features include a particular language and script combination, known as a language system, before any of your feature definitions. This is the syntax:

    languagesystem script language;

And in our example, we would do this:

    languagesystem latn NLD;

Before you define any specific language system, you should always declare this:

    languagesystem DFLT dflt;

This will register all rules for a fallback system in case an OpenType layout gets confused about which language or script your features apply to. Additionally, before you register a script with a specific language, you should register it with the default language for the same reason. So, the complete set of language system statements would look like this:

    languagesystem DFLT dflt;
    languagesystem latn dflt;
    languagesystem latn NLD;

### Lookups

We studied lookups when we went through the feature processing model, but they deserve some extra emphasis. Multiple lookups are allowed in a single feature and the fact that they process an entire glyph run before moving on to the next lookup makes them incredibly useful. We can use this technique to produce some very complex behavior. For example, in a swash feature it is often best to insert swashes first at the beginning and then at the end of words in separate passes. We can do this easily with lookups.

You can also reuse lookups if they are declared outside of a feature. To do this, define your lookup like this:

    lookup Example {
        # rules go here
    } Example;

Then, inside of your features you can have this lookup called by referencing its name:

    lookup Example;

This is useful if you want to share some rules across multiple features.  
_Example for sharing lookup?_  
_A lookup for superior letters may be a good example; you can define the lookup inside `ordn`, and then reuse it in `sups`. An example with inferior numerals that uses `subs` and `sinf` may be even better._


# Putting It All Together

You now have the building blocks for writing everything from simple to complex features and you understand how it is actually going to work. Right? Great! Now, let's start looking at the bigger picture.

All of your features will be in a text file somewhere, either stored in your font source file or in an external file. I like to structure the code in my files like this:

1. languagesystem declarations
2. global classes
3. all substitution features
4. all positioning features

The language system declarations must come first. After that, the order is up to you, but I like to add any classes that I will use frequently, then all of the substitution features and then all of the positioning features.

## Building a Feature

Here is a basic example combined into the proper form:

    languagesystem DFLT dflt;
    langaugesystem latn dflt;

    @lowercase = [a    b    c];
    @uppercase = [A    B    C];
    @smallcaps = [A.sc B.sc C.sc];

    @figures         = [zero    one    two];
    @figuresSmallcap = [zero.sc one.sc two.sc];

    @punctuation         = [exclam];
    @punctuationSmallcap = [exclam.sc];

    feature smcp {
        sub @lowercase by @smallcaps;
    } smcp;

    feature c2sc {
        sub @uppercase by @smallcaps;
        sub @lowercase by @smallcaps; _Is this line necessary?_
        sub @figures by @figuresSmallcap;
        sub @punctuation by @punctuationSmallcap;
    } c2sc;

Note that there are no lookups declared. Why? The first lookup is implied to be anything before you define a lookup. Consider this example:

    feature c2sc {
        sub @uppercase by @smallcaps;

        lookup Lowercase {
            sub @lowercase by @smallcaps;
        } Lowercase;
    } c2sc;

The first rule, sub @uppercase by @smallcaps;, is implicitly in a lookup. The result is the same as this:

    feature c2sc {
        lookup Uppercase {
            sub @uppercase by @smallcaps;
        } Uppercase;

        lookup Lowercase {
            sub @lowercase by @smallcaps;
        } Lowercase;
    } c2sc;

That's pretty much how you combine things. There will be more examples that demonstrate advanced techniques that you can study later.

## Feature Order

The order in which you list your features is very important. This is the order in which they will be processed. If you do something like put your ligatures before any alternates, your alternate code will have to take into account potential ligatures. It may even possibly have to break the ligatures down. That's possible, but it results in overly complex code that is hard to read, edit and debug. I generally order my features like this:

1. script language specific forms (locl)
2. fractions (frac, numr, dnom)
3. superscript and subscript (sups, subs)
4. figures (lnum, onum, pnum, tnum)
5. ordinals (ordn)
6. small caps (smcp, c2sc)
7. all caps (case)
8. various alternates (cswh, titl, salt, ss01, ss02, ss...)
9. ligatures (liga, dlig)
10. manual alternate access (aalt)
11. capital spacing (cpsp)

There are, of course, exceptions. The point is that you should think through this ordering so that you don't make things harder on yourself than you have to.

## Including an External File

If you are working on a family that shares features across multiple styles, it's cumbersome to store the features in each font source file. To get around this, you can store the features in an external file and reference them from the features in your font source file. To do this you use the include keyword:

    include(features/family.fea);

The text inside of the parenthesis must be the path to your external features file relative to the font source file. In the example above, the file family.fea is located in a folder called features right next to my font source file.

You can even include multiple files in a single font source file. For example:

    include(features/family.fea);
    include(features/bold-kern.fea);

Even in other folders, below the current one:

    include(../tables.fea);


# Common Features And Techniques

Up until now, almost everything that has been discussed has been the official way to do things or established common practice. The next section is far more subjective as there are numerous ways to write the code to create certain behaviors. What follows includes my own personal opinion.

I have prepared a demo font that includes all of the features and techniques defined below. You can open it up in your favorite font editor and play around with the features if you want to see how they work. The feature tags in the code below don't always match the tags in the font. I had to do it this way since there can't be more than one version of each feature.

The features in the demo font are by no means to complete or an indication of what is necessary to include in a particular feature. You should develop your own interpretation of what should be included in each feature based on the design of your font.

## Glyph Run and Word Boundary Detection

Often we want to make substitutions based on the bounds of words and glyph runs. For example, to insert a swash only at the beginning or at the end of a word. There are three features in the specification for dealing with these situations:

- `init` — Performs substitutions only at the beginning of a word.
- `fina` — Performs substitutions only at the end of a word.
- `medi` — Performs substitutions only on the glyphs between the first and last in a word.

Unfortunately the specification is a bit vague about how these are supposed to be implemented. The Unicode specification details a word boundary detection algorithm and conceivably that's what would be used by the layout engines that are processing your font. That specification is quite thorough, but it thinks about word boundaries in a different way than type designers do (or at least the type designer writing this does). For example, where are the word boundaries in this text?

    Hello “World!”

They are at the o, the W and the d. (I'm 99.999999% sure about this, but I should test it again.) If we use this for swashes our W and d are likely to clash with the marks “ and ! around them. We often think of word boundaries as an empty space around words. If we want to use init and fina, we'll need to build in exceptions. You can certainly do that, but I generally do it all myself with some special classes:

- all -- This class contains all glyphs.
- filled -- This class contains all glyphs that contain positive space.
- empty -- This glyph contains all glyphs that contain only negative space.

With these, we can build lookups that handle boundary detection reasonable well enough for things like swashes.

    lookup GlyphRunInitial {
        ignore sub @all @initialsOff';
        sub @initialsOff' by @initialsOn;
    } GlyphRunInitial;

    lookup GlyphRunFinal {
        ignore sub @finalsOff' @all;
        sub @finalsOff' by @finalsOn;
    } GlyphRunFinal;

    lookup WordInitial {
        ignore sub @filled @initialsOff';
        sub @initialsOff' by @initialsOn;
    } WordInitial;

    lookup WordMedial {
        sub @filled @medialOff' @filled by @medialOn;
    } WordMedial;

    lookup WordFinal {
        ignore sub @finalsOff' @filled;
        sub @finalsOff' by @finalsOn;
    } WordFinal;

To be clear, you should not use this for shaping Arabic or anything like that. This is strictly for aesthetic substitutions like swashes.

## Script And Language Specific Forms

The locl feature is specifically designed to implement global script and language specific changes that need to happen before any other features are processed. You can certainly put stylistic specific changes in other features, but the big important ones should be in locl.

    feature locl {

        script latn;

            language NLD exclude_dflt;
                lookup DutchIJ {
                    sub IJ by IJ.dutch;
                } DutchIJ;

    } locl;

## Fractions

I have used two different algorithms for implementing on-the-fly fractions. The first is fairly straightforward. The second is more complex but I think it is easier for users.

### Method 1: Individual

This method has been around for as long as I have been working on OpenType features. Adobe probably developed it in the very early days of the .fea language. It is probably still the most common implementation.

    feature frac {
        @slash = [slash fraction];

        lookup FractionNumerators {
            sub @figures by @figuresNumerator;
        } FractionNumerators;

        sub [@slash @figuresDenominator] @figuresNumerator' by @figuresDenominator;
        sub slash by fraction;
    } frac;

### Method 2: Contextual

Around 2006 Kent Lew asked me if I had any ideas for a better fraction implementation. Specifically, he was referring to the fact that with the existing implementation users had to manually select only the text that should be converted to fractions and apply the feature. If the feature was applied to more than just that text all numbers not in a fraction would be converted to numerators. This was a big problem in things like cookbooks where there could be thousands of little bits of text that had to be converted to fractions.

I developed a new method that is built on the common form of writing fractions as an integer, a space, a numerator, a slash and a denominator. For example: 2 1/2. The code considers 1-10 numbers followed by a slash followed by 1 or more numbers to be a fraction. The slash is converted to a fraction bar, the numbers before the slash are converted to numerators and the numbers after the slash are converted to denominators. If the new fraction is preceded by a number followed by a space, the space is converted to a thin space to pull the fraction closer to the integer. After I published the first version of this code, Karsten Luecke pointed out some some problems with dates, German tax numbers and things like that. I published a new version that handles these properly and this version is below.

With this users can globally activate fractions. The only drawback that I have found with this is that it doesn't allow numerators to be longer than 10 numbers long. In the unlikely event that a user runs into this problem, they can select the unconverted numerators and activate the numerator feature.

     feature frac {

        lookup FractionBar {
            ignore sub slash @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures @figures @figures @figures @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash @figures @figures @figures @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures @figures @figures @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash @figures @figures @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures @figures @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash @figures @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash @figures slash';
            ignore sub slash' @figures slash;
            ignore sub slash slash';
            ignore sub slash' slash;
            sub @figures slash' @figures by fraction;
        } FractionBar;

        lookup Numerator1 {
            sub @figures' fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator1;

        lookup Numerator2 {
            sub @figures' @figuresNumerator fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator2;

        lookup Numerator3 {
            sub @figures' @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator3;

        lookup Numerator4 {
            sub @figures' @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator4;

        lookup Numerator5 {
            sub @figures' @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator5;

        lookup Numerator6 {
            sub @figures' @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator6;

        lookup Numerator7 {
            sub @figures' @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator7;

        lookup Numerator8 {
            sub @figures' @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator8;

        lookup Numerator9 {
            sub @figures' @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator9;

        lookup Numerator10 {
            sub @figures' @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator @figuresNumerator fraction by @figuresNumerator;
        } Numerator10;

        lookup Denominator {
            sub [fraction @figuresDenominator] @figures' by @figuresDenominator;
        } Denominator;

        sub @figures space' @figuresNumerator by uni2009;
    } frac;

### Numerators

The `numr` feature is designed to convert all numbers to numerators.

    feature numr {
        sub @figures by @figuresNumerator;
    } numr;

### Denominators

The `dnom` feature is designed to convert all numbers to denominators.

    feature dnom {
        sub @figures by @figuresDenominator;
    } dnom;

## Superscript

The `sups` feature is for superscript forms.

    feature sups {
        sub @figures by @figuresSuperscript;
        sub @letters by @lettersSuperscript;
    } sups;

## Subscript

The `subs` feature is for subscript forms.

    feature subs {
        sub @figures by @figuresSubscript;
        sub @letters by @lettersSubscript;
    } subs;

## Figures

If your font only includes one figure style, you don't need to do anything. If you do have more than one, you have to do some awkward things due to some odd behaviors in various applications. First off, it's best to define a feature for your default figures even though it will never be used. For example, in the demo font the default figures are lining and there are old style figures as alternates. First up we need to define the lining figures feature (lnum) even though it will never actually be used. Then we define the old style feature (onum).

    feature lnum {
        sub @figuresOldStyle by @figures;
    } lnum;

    feature onum {
        sub @figures by @figuresOldStyle;
    } onum;

Likewise, if your default figures are proportional and you have tabular alternates, you need to define the proportional figures feature (pnum) and then define the tabular figures feature (tnum).

    feature pnum {
        sub @figuresTabular by @figures;
        sub @figuresOldStyleTabular by @figuresOldStyle;
    } pnum;

    feature tnum {
        sub @figures by @figuresTabular;
        sub @figuresOldStyle by @figuresOldStyleTabular;
    } tnum;

## Ordinals

The ordn feature is for ordinal forms.   
_The neccessity of this feature is questionable, since the languages that use ordinals have them on the keyboard._

    feature ordn {
        sub [A a] by ordfeminine;
        sub [O o] by ordmasculine;
    } ordn;

## Small Caps

There are two features that invoke small caps: small caps `smcp` and “caps to small caps” or “all small caps” `c2sc`. The latter version is for situations in which the user wants everything possible, not just letters, to be converted to small cap forms. (something about not doing case conversion, but being aware of things like the germanbls, dotlessi?)

    feature smcp {
        sub @lowercase by @smallCaps;
    } smcp;

    feature c2sc {
        sub @uppercase by @smallCaps;
        sub @lowercase by @smallCaps;
        sub @figures by @figuresSmallCap;
    } c2sc;

## All Caps

There are two features that should be activated when the user indicates that they want all text converted to uppercase. The `case` feature transforms any glyphs that should be changed to an uppercase alternate. You should not define the transformation from lowercase to uppercase for alphabetic forms. The layout engine will do that for you.

    feature case {
        sub @punctuationUppercaseOff by @punctuationUppercaseOn;
    } case;

The `cpsp` feature allows you to define specific spacing for all caps settings:

    feature cpsp {
        pos @uppercase <100 0 200 0>;
        pos @punctuationUppercaseOn <100 0 200 0>;
    } cpsp;

Note that these features will not be activated whenever the user types in all capitals. The features must be activated manually.

## Swashes

There are two swash features `swsh` `cswh`. I prefer to use the contextual version `cswh`. What this feature does will depend on the swash glyphs in your font.

    feature cswh {
        ignore sub @filled @swashInitialsOff';
        sub @swashInitialsOff' by @swashInitialsOn;
    } cswh;

## Titling Alternates

The titling alternates feature `titl` is, as its name suggests, for titling specific alternates.

    feature titl {
        sub @uppercase by @titlingCaps;
    } titl;

## Stylistic Sets

There are 20 special feature tags that allow you to develop your own behavior that doesn't neatly fit into any of the registered layout tags. These are known as stylistic sets and have tags `ss01`, `ss02`, `ss03` and so on. The implementation of the rules in these is completely arbitrary.

## Ligatures

There are several features that are designed to work with ligatures. The two most prominent are Common Ligatures `liga` and Discretionary Ligatures `dlig`.

The Common Ligatures feature is for ligatures that you think should be used almost all of the time.

    feature liga {
        sub f i by f_i;
        sub f l by f_l;
    } liga;

The Discretionary Ligatures feature is for ligatures that you think should be used sparingly.

    feature dlig {
        sub O O by O_O;
    } dlig;

As everywhere else, the ordering of the rules is very important within these features. You should always order them from longest glyph sequence to shortest. For example:

    sub o f f i by o_f_f_i; 
    sub f f i by f_f_i;
    sub f f by f_f;
    sub f i by f_i;

Would this sequence be ordered from bottom to top, the `f_f_i` and `o_f_f_i`  would have no chance of ever occurring, since their source glyphs already would have been converted beforehand.

## Manual Alternate Access

There is one special feature that is used to determine the alternates displayed in the glyph access palette in popular design software. This feature `aalt` is processed after all other substitution features regardless of where you have it ordered in your feature definitions.

There are a couple of different ways to define the rules in this feature, but I prefer to do it manually with individual one from many rules.

    feature aalt {
        sub A from [A.swash A.title A.random1 A.random2 A.sc];
        sub B from [B.swash B.title B.random1 B.random2 B.sc];
        sub C from [C.swash C.title C.random1 C.random2 C.sc];
        sub D from [D.swash D.title D.random1 D.random2 D.sc];
        sub E from [E.swash E.title E.random1 E.random2 E.sc];
        sub F from [F.swash F.title F.random1 F.random2 F.sc];
        sub G from [G.swash G.title G.random1 G.random2 G.sc];
        sub H from [H.swash H.title H.random1 H.random2 H.sc];
        sub I from [I.swash I.title I.random1 I.random2 I.sc];
        sub J from [J.swash J.title J.random1 J.random2 J.alt J.scalt J.sc];
        sub K from [K.swash K.title K.random1 K.random2 K.sc];
        sub L from [L.swash L.title L.random1 L.random2 L.sc];
        sub M from [M.swash M.title M.random1 M.random2 M.sc];
        sub N from [N.swash N.title N.random1 N.random2 N.sc];
        sub O from [O.swash O.title O.random1 O.random2 O.sc];
        sub P from [P.swash P.title P.random1 P.random2 P.sc];
        sub Q from [Q.swash Q.title Q.random1 Q.random2 Q.sc];
        sub R from [R.swash R.title R.random1 R.random2 R.sc];
        sub S from [S.swash S.title S.random1 S.random2 S.sc];
        sub T from [T.swash T.title T.random1 T.random2 T.sc];
        sub U from [U.swash U.title U.random1 U.random2 U.sc];
        sub V from [V.swash V.title V.random1 V.random2 V.sc];
        sub W from [W.swash W.title W.random1 W.random2 W.sc];
        sub X from [X.swash X.title X.random1 X.random2 X.sc];
        sub Y from [Y.swash Y.title Y.random1 Y.random2 Y.sc];
        sub Z from [Z.swash Z.title Z.random1 Z.random2 Z.sc];
        sub IJ from [IJ.dutch];
        sub zero from [zero.den zero.num zero.old zero.sub zero.sup zero.tab zero.oldtab zero.sc];
        sub one from [one.den one.num one.old one.sub one.sup one.tab one.oldtab one.sc];
        sub two from [two.den two.num two.old two.sub two.sup two.tab two.oldtab two.sc];
        sub three from [three.den three.num three.old three.sub three.sup three.tab three.oldtab three.sc];
        sub four from [four.den four.num four.old four.sub four.sup four.tab four.oldtab four.sc];
        sub five from [five.den five.num five.old five.sub five.sup five.tab five.oldtab five.sc];
        sub six from [six.den six.num six.old six.sub six.sup six.tab six.oldtab six.sc];
        sub seven from [seven.den seven.num seven.old seven.sub seven.sup seven.tab seven.oldtab seven.sc];
        sub eight from [eight.den eight.num eight.old eight.sub eight.sup eight.tab eight.oldtab eight.sc];
        sub nine from [nine.den nine.num nine.old nine.sub nine.sup nine.tab nine.oldtab nine.sc];
        sub exclamdown from [exclamdown.uc];
        sub questiondown from [questiondown.uc];
        sub at from [at.uc];
    } aalt;

## Fun Stuff

Small caps and swashes are fun, but for me the real fun is in making fonts do unexpected things. Below are various unusual problems that I've been faced with and how I solved them.

### Randomization

Everyone wants their font to look like the glyphs were randomly drawn. But, let's establish something first: No one will ever do randomization better than LettError did in their famous Beowolf. No one. Still want try some randomization? Okay.

Randomization is a bit of a Holy Grail in the OpenType world. The problem is that it's not actually possible for a couple of reasons. For one thing, we can only select from alternates, not actually modify glyph outlines. For another, for true pseudo-randomization there needs to be an external source that influences the random selection process and we can't build a random seed generator with the OpenType tables. So, we have to fake it. There are a number of methods that can be used to do this. I have three that I like.

(PS: That `rand` "random alternates" feature in the OpenType Layout Tag Registry? It's not supported widely, if at all. Sorry.)

#### Method 1: Endless Cycle

This method is useful when you don't have a preferred version of a glyph. For example, say you draw three glyphs for every character and you want those spread out across the text. This method will cycle between the glyphs.

For example:

    (illustration of AAAAAAAAAAAA in the demo font)

Given enough alternates, this creates an effective illusion in a large block of text.

The code is very simple:

    feature calt {
        @randomCycle1 = [@uppercase];
        @randomCycle2 = [A.random1 B.random1 C.random1 D.random1 E.random1 F.random1 G.random1 H.random1 I.random1 J.random1 K.random1 L.random1 M.random1 N.random1 O.random1 P.random1 Q.random1 R.random1 S.random1 T.random1 U.random1 V.random1 W.random1 X.random1 Y.random1 Z.random1];
        @randomCycle3 = [A.random2 B.random2 C.random2 D.random2 E.random2 F.random2 G.random2 H.random2 I.random2 J.random2 K.random2 L.random2 M.random2 N.random2 O.random2 P.random2 Q.random2 R.random2 S.random2 T.random2 U.random2 V.random2 W.random2 X.random2 Y.random2 Z.random2];

        sub @randomCycle1 @randomCycle1' by @randomCycle2;
        sub @randomCycle2 @randomCycle1' by @randomCycle3;
    } calt;

#### Method 2: Duplicate Eliminator

This method is useful if you want to tightly control the deployment of alternates. Specifically, if you only want an alternate to appear if the glyph that it is an alternate to has appeared recently.

For example:

    (illustration of BOOKKEEPING in the demo font)

The code is lengthy, but fairly straightforward:

    feature calt {

        @randomDuplicateSkip = [@uppercase];

        lookup RandomDuplicate1 {
            sub A A' by A.random1;
            sub B B' by B.random1;
            sub C C' by C.random1;
            sub D D' by D.random1;
            sub E E' by E.random1;
            sub F F' by F.random1;
            sub G G' by G.random1;
            sub H H' by H.random1;
            sub I I' by I.random1;
            sub J J' by J.random1;
            sub K K' by K.random1;
            sub L L' by L.random1;
            sub M M' by M.random1;
            sub N N' by N.random1;
            sub O O' by O.random1;
            sub P P' by P.random1;
            sub Q Q' by Q.random1;
            sub R R' by R.random1;
            sub S S' by S.random1;
            sub T T' by T.random1;
            sub U U' by U.random1;
            sub V V' by V.random1;
            sub W W' by W.random1;
            sub X X' by X.random1;
            sub Y Y' by Y.random1;
            sub Z Z' by Z.random1;
        } RandomDuplicate1;

        lookup RandomDuplicate2 {
            sub A @randomDuplicateSkip A' by A.random1;
            sub B @randomDuplicateSkip B' by B.random1;
            sub C @randomDuplicateSkip C' by C.random1;
            sub D @randomDuplicateSkip D' by D.random1;
            sub E @randomDuplicateSkip E' by E.random1;
            sub F @randomDuplicateSkip F' by F.random1;
            sub G @randomDuplicateSkip G' by G.random1;
            sub H @randomDuplicateSkip H' by H.random1;
            sub I @randomDuplicateSkip I' by I.random1;
            sub J @randomDuplicateSkip J' by J.random1;
            sub K @randomDuplicateSkip K' by K.random1;
            sub L @randomDuplicateSkip L' by L.random1;
            sub M @randomDuplicateSkip M' by M.random1;
            sub N @randomDuplicateSkip N' by N.random1;
            sub O @randomDuplicateSkip O' by O.random1;

#### Method 3: Quantum

This method is for dedicated randomization aficionados. A little history about how this came about: in 2005 I wanted to see if I could come up with a randomization technique that produced less predictable results than the methods above. I realized that I could use the text that the feature is transforming as a psurdo-pseudo-random seed. I was reading a tiny bit about quantum mechanics around the same time and my very limited understanding of some of the experiments in that field gave me an idea. That's a story that I won't get into here. Anyway, the code is long and convoluted, but the idea is pretty simple. I'll give you an overview.

Before we get to rules, we establish several important classes. First we create two trigger classes. The first will contain half of the glyphs in the font and the next will contain the other half of the glyphs. These need to be randomly chosen. In other words, don't put A-Z in the same class. That won't produce the desired result. Next, we establish alternate states for glyphs. These states are defined in a series of classes. Each of these classes contain a glyph and its alternate. The next class contains the opposite of the previous class. For example:

    @class1 = [A A.alt];
    @class2 = [A.alt A];

Finally, we establish a skip class that contains everything in the font.

The glyph processing happens in a series of lookups that each pass over the entire glyph run. As a glyph, let's call it P, is being processed the lookup backtracks a specific number of glyphs. The glyph at the beginning of that backtrack, let's call it B, is then tested against a class, let's call it @T. Importantly, @T only contains half of the glyphs in the font. If B is in @T, P is switched to an alternate state. Thus, each glyph state is dependent on the state of all the glyphs that precede it. Given that the text is most likely going to have unpredictable letter combinations, we get a fairly effective randomization. For example:

    (illustration of the same string repeated in the demo font)

Is it real randomization? No. Is it perfect? No. Is it incredibly complex and hard to write? Yes. (Unless you use a script to write it.) Can it be slow if a font contains a large number of glyphs and the glyph run being processed is very long? Yes. Is it awesome anyway? I think so.

#### Bonus: Quantum Positioning

It's possible to extend the quantum randomization method above and use it to randomly shift glyphs around. Possible, but probably not advisable. The support for this is almost certainly going to be uneven.

The code is similar to the substitution method. In this case, instead of states, the cumulative effect that lookups have on glyph records is used.

# Troubleshooting

Should this section even be in here? What form should it take?

(Yes, but perhaps Trouble and Tips?)

- did you forget a special character? you probably forgot a } ; or something like that.
- did you name a lookup or class with the same name twice?
- all of the rule types in a lookup must be the same type
- table overflow (subtable, useExtension)
- features can't know if other features are active or not
- complex contextual rules leading to slowness of overflow errors (limit the contexts to what is *likely* to happen, not *everything*)


# Things That Should Not Be In This Document (and why)

Should this be in the final document? It's here now to keep me on track.

- ranges in glyph classes (why: not that useful, hard to debug)
- CID (why: complex)
- contour point (why: complex)
- GDEF (why: complex)
- named value records (why: haven't ever used it)
- subtable breaking (why: because I said so)
- enumerating pairs (why: complex)
- contextual kerning (why: support is consistent)
- the aalt construction technique of including complete features (why: I don't like it)
- the optical size feature (why: not widely supported) _(I think we use it for InDesign)_
- tables (OS/2, hhea, name, etc.) (why: your font editor is going to do this for you)
- anonymous data blocks (why: obviously)
- reversed chaining lookup types (why: too complex for this)
- feature implementations (adobe CS, CSS, etc.) (why: not something I want to keep up to date)
_Link to the Typotheque Table – still a good overview._
- known bugs of implementations (why: not something I want to keep up to date)
- cursive positioning (why: too complex for this; not easy to test)
- mark to base positioning (why: too complex for this; not easy to test)
- mark to ligature positioning (why: too complex for this; not easy to test)
- mark to mark positioning (why: too complex for this; not easy to test)
- lookupflag (why: relates to the positioning rules that aren't covered)

_I think that the cursive and the mark-related features are interesting, and actually not that difficult to write and to understand. But I agree that it does not need to be in version 1 of this document because they'll be only relevant to a small set of people._

# Thanks

Thanks to the Adobe Type Department for developing the .fea syntax. It gets criticized from time to time, but it is actually a great abstraction of the GSUB, GPOS and GDEF binary data structures. I've tried, and failed, to invent a better syntax several times. .fea is hard to beat. Thanks Adobe!

# Appendix: My .fea Style Guide

I like to make my code look nice. I'm a designer, so I'll even go so far as to say that I try to make it look typographic. My goal is to make it comfortable to read because, as Guido van Rossum once put it, code is read much more often than it is written. Debugging problems is not fun. Debugging problems in poorly structured, hard to read code is a bag of hurt.

Honestly, I don't really care if you use my style recommendations or if you invent your own. There is plenty in this style guide to disagree with and even I don't always follow these rules. What I do hope you will do is find a consistent way to structure and style your code so that it is easy for you to work with. That said, I am 100% right and everyone else is 100% wrong.

My preferred style has grown out of my experience with Python and my general adherence to the legendary PEP 8. So, it shares some traits with Python code.

## Whitespace

I use whitespace, both horizontal and vertical, to indicate logical groupings. Indentation is used to visually connect features, lookups, scripts and languages. Blank lines are used to indicate feature changes, sections and so on.

I prefer that indentation be done with spaces (four per indentation level), but I'm not religious about it. If you prefer tabs, use tabs. However, do not under any circumstance mix tabs and spaces. Similarly, do not put pointless spaces at the end of a line.

There should be no lines that contain no characters other than spaces. That's just gross.

## Column Width

I don't have a set column width for class definitions or rules. I find that they are harder to read if they are broken over multiple lines than if they are in one long line. I do wrap my comments if they are longer than 50-60 characters in length. I try to follow standard typographic practice when writing and breaking lines in comments. Comments are among the most important things in the code, so I try to make them ultra readable.

## Comments

I precede all comments with a single # followed by a space.

    # This looks nice.
    #This does not.

Comments are always indented to the level of the code that they are meant to document. Sudden horizontal shifts are jarring.

## Features

I structure my features like this:

    # -----------------
    # Example Feature 1
    # -----------------

    feature xmp1 {
        # rules, lookups, etc.
    } xmp1;


    # -----------------
    # Example Feature 2
    # -----------------

    feature xmp2 {
        # rules, lookups, etc.
    } xmp2;

Each feature, or group of features in the case of interrelated features like figure styles, gets a human readable header with line of hyphens above and below. The number of hyphens matches the number of characters in the header. One blank line follows this.

The feature begins unindented with the keyword, a space, the tag, a space and the opening brace. It is closed with an unindented closing brace, a space, the tag and the closing semicolon. Between the opening and closing lines, the indentation level of any line containing text is increased one level.

Features always have two blank lines between them and whatever is next in the file.

## Lookups

Lookups are structured like this:

    lookup ExampleLookup1 {
        # rules
    } ExampleLookup1;

    lookup ExampleLookup2 {
        # rules
    } ExampleLookup2;

The lookup begins at the current indent level with the keyword, a space, the lookup name, a space and the opening brace. It is closed with an unindented closing brace, a space, the lookup name and the closing semicolon. Between the opening and closing lines, the indentation level of any line containing text is increased one level.

Lookup names should be descriptive of what the lookup does. For example, SwashInitials, QuadrupleLigatures, FractionBar. The names are composed of characters in A-z a-z and 0-9. The first letter should be capitalized and other letters may be capitalized as needed to improve readability.

There should be at least one blank line above a lookup and one blank line below.

## Classes

Classes are defined line this:

    @exampleClass1 = [A B C];
    @exampleClass2 = [a b c];

The definition begins at the current indent level with the @ special character, the class name, a space, an =, a space, the opening bracket, a space delimited list of glyph names in a meaningful order, a closing bracket and the closing semicolon.

Classes should be defined on a single line. The definition may be broken into multiple lines only in rare circumstances.

Class names should be descriptive of the class' contents and purpose. For example, @uppercase, @figuresNumerator, @randomCycle1. If there are two classes that are intended for substituting with each other, for example if you have swash targets and swash replacements, it's good to tag the classes with Off and On for clarity. For example, @swashInitialsOff and @swashInitialsOn. Class names are composed of characters in A-z a-z and 0-9. The first letter should be lowercase and other letters may be capitalized as needed to improve readability.

If there are two or more classes that are intended for substituting with each other, readability can be greatly increased by using spaces between glyph names as alignment padding. For example:

    @figures         = [zero     one     two];
    @figuresTabular  = [zero.tab one.tab two.tab];
    @figuresSmallCap = [zero.sc  one.sc  two.sc];

## Rules

Rules are defined with the short version of the keywords, sub and pos, instead of the long versions, substitution and position. The rules are always on a single line and they are always written at the current indentation level. Class names are preferred over inline classes, but that's not always practical or possible. There should be no double spaces and there should be no space before the closing semicolon.

## Script and Language

Script and language definitions each increase the indentation level by one level until the next script or language definition or until the end of the feature. For example:

    feature locl {

        script latn;

            language TRK exclude_dflt;

                lookup IDOT {
                    sub i' by idotaccent;
                } IDOT;

            language AZE exclude_dflt;
                lookup IDOT;

            language CRT exclude_dflt;
                lookup IDOT;

            language ROM exclude_dflt;

                lookup SCEDILLA {
                    sub scedilla by uni0219;
                    sub Scedilla by uni0218;
                } SCEDILLA;

    } locl;
